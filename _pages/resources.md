Here are some links to our resources and related sites:

* [**pyOpenSci Github Organization**](https://github.com/pyOpenSci): Contains our [software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repo that hosts the peer-review process. Also contains our guidebook, cookiecutter, and governance repos (see below).

* [**pyOpenSci Discourse Forum**](https://pyopensci.discourse.group/): Our community forum for discussing all things pyOpenSci. Have feedback or ideas about the review process? Need help finishing or maintaining your Python package? Have a question about how to use one of pyOpenSci’s packages? Our forum is the best place for these types of discussion.

* [**pyOpenSci Guidebook**](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/intro): Contains information for package authors and reviewers, including our [package guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/authoring/index.html#packaging-guide), our [peer review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/intro.html), and tips for [package maintenance](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/open-source-software-peer-review/policies-guidelines.html?highlight=ownership%20maintenance#after-acceptance-package-ownership-and-maintenance). If you are interested in submitting a package to pyOpenSci, start with our [author guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/authoring/index.html) and the links within it.

* [**pyOpenSci's Governance Repo**](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/governance): Where we discuss the direction and scope of pyOpenSci. We're a community organization, so please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/governance/issues) if you have any questions or concerns!

* [**pyOpenSci cookiecutter**](https://cookiecutter-pyopensci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): We created a cookiecutter template to make packaging your python code easier. The cookiecutter follows all our guidelines from our [packaging guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/authoring/index.html#packaging-guide).

* [**rOpenSci**](https://ropensci.org/): We draw inspiration from rOpenSci, a community to help promote, teach, and grow best-practices in software development for the Scientific R stack. They have a wonderful array of resources for R, such as their [collection of scientific R packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/). If you use R, we encourage you to get involved with them.
