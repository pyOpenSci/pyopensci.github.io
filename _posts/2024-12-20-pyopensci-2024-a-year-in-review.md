## Introduction


2024 has been a transformative year for the pyOpenSci community—-a year of
growth, learning together, and meaningful connections. As I write this, I am
humbled but all that we've achieved together.

Together, we:

- Launched a new **Training Initiative** to empower open-source newcomers.
- Expanded our **Software Peer Review Program**, increasing its global impact.
- Welcomed **XXX new contributors**, with many making their first-ever contributions
  to open source through our beginner-friendly sprints.
- Co-developed **XXX new lessons** to support Python packaging, cleaner code,
  and sharing and publishing code.

As we look back on an incredible year, we celebrate these milestones and set
the stage for an even more ambitious 2025.

Here’s a look back on what we accomplished together in 2024 and where we're heading next.

**TODO: count all sprints (bane), all training events (airtable), all other events (airtable) and then count all package reviews for 2024**

Our community has submitted over XXX prs and issued to pyOpenSci.

## Training events: empowering our global community

In 2024, we launched the pyOpenSci
[Training Initiative](https://www.pyopensci.org/blog/pyos-education-announcement.html)
to lower barriers to open science for Pythonistas worldwide. Our events were a
resounding success, supported by **XX volunteers** and attended by **XXX
participants** from **XX countries**—both online and in person.

### **Event Highlights**

- **Fall Festival:** Our first-ever online [Fall Festival](link-to-blog-when-published) kicked off with incredible keynote speakers. Who introduced participants to mystmarkdown, the journey of moving from academic to open source, and the significance of and components of reducibility to science. Participants learned in dynamic spatial chat allowed for real-time collaboration and learning together.

- We also taught **Two Intro to Python Packaging Workshops:** In these training, we had dozens of of participants successfully create their first Python packages following our [beginning to end beginner-friendly packaging tutorials](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/intro.html).

These trainings highlight the growing demand for inclusive, high-quality resources in open science and the power of community collaboration.

## A thriving contributor community: how contributions to pyOpenSci have skyrocketed

In 2024, the pyOpenSci contributor community grew to **278 people** from around the world! Through beginner-
friendly sprints and mentorship, we supported new contributors and celebrated
their successes. And in this year was the first where volunteer contributions began to outnumber staff contributions.

Wow!

Figure: plot of new contributions over time might be most impactful??

### **Empowering first-time contributors**

One of the biggest drivers of this growth was our [**two beginner-friendly sprints**](https://www.pyopensci.org/blog/pyopensci-pyconus-2024-sprints.html). These sprints exemplified the power of collaboration, helping many participants make their first contributions to open source.

- Hosted at **PyCon US** and **[SciPy/Tacoma, Washington]**, the sprints welcomed over **XX participants** from **XX countries**.
- Focused on hands-on mentorship to guide contributors through impactful contributions.

For many attendees, these sprints marked their first foray into open source:

These efforts have strengthened our contributor community and sparked new initiatives, like translating our packaging guide to Spanish and Japanese.

### **Highlights**
- **Community growth:** Active contributors increased by **XX%**, bringing the total to **XXX contributors**.
- **Momentum in contributions:** Issues and pull requests grew significantly over 2023, with **X pull requests** improving [specific areas, e.g., documentation, testing].
  ![Issues and PR Growth](#)
- **Global reach:** Members translated our packaging guide into Spanish and Japanese, expanding accessibility worldwide.
- **New tools:** Contributors developed a packaging copier template, now central to our [training workshops](#), making Python packaging more accessible.

## Beginner-friendly content development: harnessing diverse expertise

A defining strength of the pyOpenSci community is its commitment to creating accessible technical lessons for Pythonistas of all skill levels. In 2024, this shone through with the completion of our tutorial, **"How to Create a Python Package"**, a major step toward making packaging more approachable.

This tutorial’s strength lies in the diversity of its creators—from PyPA maintainers and packaging experts to beginners crafting their first package. This range of perspectives ensures the content is accurate, thorough, and welcoming to newcomers.

### Bridging communities to co-develop accessible technical content

Our collaborative process brought together contributors across experience levels to create content that:

- **Blends expertise:** Developers, scientists, and beginners shaped an inclusive resource.
- **Demystifies packaging:** Clear, precise content lowers barriers for new users.
- **Engages visually:** Graphics provide clarity for visual learners navigating complex topics.

This effort exemplifies the unique power of pyOpenSci to bridge expertise, build community, and strengthen the open source ecosystem.

## Software submission highlights

The pyOpenSci software peer review program empowers scientists to build and improve the tools they rely on to process and analyze data. In 2024, we grew our ecosystem of scientific Python packages to **39**, thanks to the impactful efforts of our editorial and review teams.

Our editorial team expanded to **XX members**, supported by four rotating Editors-in-Chief and **XX reviewers**, all volunteering their time to make open-source software better. Their collective effort ensures that [every reviewed package in our ecosystem](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html) meets the highest quality and usability standards.

In 2024, we received **28+ submissions**, with **XX packages** accepted into our program. Highlights of the year include:

- **Partnership impact**: **[Add specific number]** packages were published in [JOSS](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/joss.html), amplifying their visibility and credibility.
- **Expanding ecosystems**: Three packages also were accepted for [Astropy affiliation](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/astropy.html), through our domain community partnership program. This program is a true example of leveraging resources. By combining review processes, pyOpenSci has a strong core editorial team, and Astropy doesn't have to commit as many resources towards running its own review process.

We also began to tackle the emerging challenges of generative AI, beginning to explore how we should handle review submissions that depend on proprietary AI models. This decision brought ethical questions to the forefront, including how to balance transparency with innovation. While there is more work to do, we remain committed to addressing these challenges thoughtfully and collaboratively.

*TODO: double-check numbers*

* 2023:24 submissions
* 2024: 28 + likely a few more for 2024 (calculate in 2025)
