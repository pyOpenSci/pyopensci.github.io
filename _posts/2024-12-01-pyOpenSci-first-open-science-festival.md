# Building Momentum for the Future: Reflections on Our First Open Science Festival Week

## Introduction (Celebrate Success)

Three years ago, I envisioned an online event where our community could come together to celebrate open science, share knowledge, and learn new skills. Last month, that vision became reality with pyOpenSci’s first-ever Festival, held from October 28 to November 1. The event brought together 64 participants from over 15 countries—a global mix of researchers, developers, educators, and Python enthusiasts.

The week was packed with inspiring keynotes, hands-on workshops, and informal office hours, where participants connected and reflected on their learning. It was an incredible celebration of the amazing work happening across our community!

We kicked the event off on Monday, October 28 with a morning of free KeyNote talks headlined by **Eric Ma, Melissa Mendonça, and Rowan Cockett**. The talks couldn't have been more perfectly aligned with the training to come that week and set the stage for a truly engaging week of learning together.

Eric Ma on code readability and user-friendly setup, Melissa Mendonça on the importance of sustainability and diversity in open source communities, and Rowan Cockett on MYstMarkdown and Curvenote, a platform and tools for collaborative and transparent scientific communication

### Eric Ma
Eric Ma emphasized the importance of readability, user-friendly installation, and thorough documentation in data science projects. He shared personal experiences and best practices to highlight how these elements enhance collaboration and the overall impact of scientific work.

My favorite part of this talk was the "Roast Your Repo" exercise, which invited attendees to critique a repository from his thesis code. Together, we discussed the repo's shortcomings, including lack of documentation, testing, and modularity. This discussion emphasized the importance of open science practices when considering how reusable code or a Githubr repository is.

### Melissa Mendonça
Melissa Mendonça shared her personal journey into open source. I really appreciated the discussion of her transition from academia to a career focused on open source scientific software. It can be hard and brave to leave academia- a difficult experience I've recently endured in my career. Melissa emphasized the importance of the scientific Python ecosystem, showcasing how foundational libraries like NumPy and SciPy form the basis for a vast and interconnected network of specialized domain-specific projects. She discussed the challenges and benefits of working within a volunteer-driven community, emphasizing the need for clear governance models, transparent decision-making processes, and a thoughtful approach to engaging with consumers of the software. Melissa concludes by outlining her interpretation of open science, emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, accessibility, and the need for independent investigation of research results.

### Rowan Cockett
