Manager supports growth and development of an inclusive pyOpenSci community. Our vibrant community is
dedicated to supporting high quality Python open source software that drives open science.

## About pyOpenSci

pyOpenSci is a diverse scientific open source / open science community that:

1. Develops processes, guidelines, and training around the creation and maintenance of scientific Python packages.

pyOpenSci’s core program is open peer review of scientific Python software.
Through peer-review we enforce community-defined packaging standards while
improving usability, documentation and package quality. Further, we are creating a catalog of vetted scientific [Python tools](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html) that have ongoing
maintenance for scientists to use.

Core to our mission is increasing participation
of groups that have historically underrepresented / excluded from the open
source and open science community. We do this through mentorship, training and
strategic partnerships with existing organizations
such as [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/), [Open Science Labs](https://opensciencelabs.org/) and other
organizations.
