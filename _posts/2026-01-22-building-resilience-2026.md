## The world has changed

I'm not going to sugarcoat it—2025 was hard.

Watching organizations like the [Python Software Foundation turn down million-dollar National Science Foundation (NSF) grants](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html)
because DEIA work was no longer supported made something painfully clear: the funding landscape that has grounded so many of us is no longer reliable.

At the same time, Generative AI fundamentally changed how open source work happens. Maintainers found themselves reviewing more code than ever—much of it machine-generated—while navigating ethical questions about authorship and responsibility they didn't sign up to solve on their own.

For many of us, the ground felt unstable—not just months out, but sometimes day to day.

And yet, something important happened.

Instead of pulling back, **the pyOpenSci community leaned in**. People showed up
for each other. They reviewed, mentored, taught, organized, and adapted—often
quietly, often while navigating uncertainty of their own.

## The moment that changed everything

One moment from 2025 keeps coming back to me: our sprint at SciPy.

We had record attendance at that sprint compared to previous years! The large group self-organized. Tables moved. Whiteboards filled with ad-hoc lessons
on Git and GitHub. Experienced contributors mentored newcomers.

I think about the colleague who sat down, saw the size of the sprint group,
and asked—"how can I help?". He spent the day working with other sprinters,
helping them make their first contributions to open source.

This is one example of how baking structure and strong value systems into a community can yield incredible returns. The **community members show up for each other because that is just how pyOpenSci operates**. It's who we are, and it's magical.

That day felt like the manifestation of a blueprint. It showed what happens when you create the
right environment and empower a community to help each other. That model—
shared ownership, peer learning, mutual support—changed how I think about
building sustainable infrastructure and community.

Resilience is about building inclusive spaces for people to both engage, learn, and support each other.

## What we're building in 2026

### Shifting how we think about sustainability

One of the clearest lessons from 2025 is that a grant-dependent model alone
can't support the community-centered infrastructure pyOpenSci is
building. Grants will always matter, but they can't be the only pillar
holding us up.

As we move into 2026, pyOpenSci is shifting toward a more
diversified sustainability plan--one that centers on training, sponsorship, and
community support. And as always, our focus will remain on human-centered growth and development, which is particularly critical in our current moment of Generative AI-driven rapid change.

Value-alignment will continue to be critical as we make this shift.

### Training that connects people and builds responsible practice

In 2026, we're investing in a new type of training: programs that bring
researchers from around the world together to learn both software development
best practices *and* the responsible use of Generative AI in scientific and
open source workflows. The training will be held asynchronously to reduce barriers
to participation and increase accessibility. And it will feature incredible leaders in the open source community in an effort to connect learners to the **real heart of Open Source--people**.


We’re piloting this new training format through our [partnership with
Stanford's Open Source Program Office (OSPO)](https://www.pyopensci.org/events/pyopensci-stanford-create-python-package-workshop.html). Building on the momentum, we’ll expand this model to other university OSPOs, leveraging the strong connections within the CURIOSS network and building an organizational membership program that supports researchers at scale. While our courses will initially be designed for OSPO researchers they will be valuable to anyone looking to develop the open source and responsible us of Generative
AI skills that are in high demand in today's tech-driven job market.

Generative AI can support open source workflows, but it can't fully replace
the thought, design, and vision that only a human can implement. It also can't replace
mentorship, care, and compassion—human parts of the tech world that both fuel the
open source ecosystem and are also straining the fragile social web that supports it. Our training will continue to emphasize foundational open source skills, critical thinking and shared open source norms and workflows.

Our goal is to create learning spaces that reduce isolation, build
confidence, connect learners to the humans that drive open source, and strengthen the
communities behind scientific software.

## The people who make this possible

None of what we learned in 2025—or what we're building toward in 2026—
happened in isolation.

I'm deeply grateful to our 2025 Executive Council, **[Karen Cranston](https://github.com/kcranston)
and [April Johnson](https://github.com/aprilmj)**, for their steady guidance
and support as we navigated a challenging year. They encouraged me to embrace
sustainable leadership and supported me as I developed new programs to ensure
our long-term sustainability.

Our Editors-in-Chief—**[James Balamuta](https://github.com/coatless),
[Eliot Robson](https://github.com/eliotwrobson), and [Lauren Yee](https://github.com/yeelauren)**—
led the peer review process through a period of rapid change, navigating
AI-fueled submissions while keeping quality and care at the center.
**[Carter Rhea](https://github.com/crhea93)** stepped up as an editor
numerous times, supporting volunteers who were overburdened and leading one
of our largest reviews—Astropy—which was just accepted in early 2026.

Members of our Advisory Council—**[Carol Willing](https://github.com/willingc),
[Inessa Pawson](https://github.com/InessaPawson), and [Chase Million](https://github.com/cmillion)**—
helped me think through sustainability, partnerships, and long-term direction
with wisdom and generosity.

**And to the many community members who contributed through reviews, workshops,
sprints, writing, mentoring, and quiet acts of support—thank you. This
organization exists because you choose to show up.**

## Community matters most

When things are uncertain, community infrastructure matters most.
It's how people find support that institutions can't provide. It's how
knowledge gets shared when traditional collaboration pathways break down.
It's how we take care of each other.

That SciPy sprint showed me what's possible. When you create spaces where
people can show up, learn together, and support each other—when you do that
consistently—the community becomes the infrastructure.

This is how we build resilience. This is how we help make the world better. **Together.**
