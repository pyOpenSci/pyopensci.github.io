## pyOpenSci's approach to beginner-friendly sprints

In previous posts, I talked about:

* Our [incredible experience at PyCon US 2024](recap-pyos-pyconus-2024.html).
* My [personal experiences with the Python packaging ecosystem and building consensus
  within the scientific Python community](python-packaging-friends-dont-let-friends-package-alone.html).

Here, I will share with you what we have learned at pyOpenSci through holding
beginner-friendly sprints over the past two years.
Specifically, I want to
explore the varied motivations and barriers associated with contributions to
open source, and how pyOpenSci is addressing them.

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">

## TL;DR

* I believe that we can get more people involved in Open Source if it's done
  the right way. Despite the word "open" in the name, open source is not
  necessarily open to all people.
* By setting up infrastructure such as project boards and tagging issues as
  beginner-friendly, you are on your way towards a beginner-friendly sprint.
* Be prepared to support people who are newer to Git and GitHub.
* Create opportunities for beginners to contribute to documentation. The
  beginner lens reviewing your docs is critical to ensuring the documentation
  is usable! Documentation contributions can also be implemented entirely on
  GitHub without needing to use the command line.

## PyOpenSci's [PyCon US 2024](https://us.pycon.org/2024/) sprint

I've been running pyOpenSci sprints for about two years now. This year was my
second year leading a PyCon US sprint for pyOpenSci. I've learned a lot! While
last year we had two sprinters, this year we had a tremendous turnout of 18
people from several countries and across the United States for our 1-day
sprint. This resulted in over 35 issues and pull requests, where volunteers
helped fix issues on our website, in our tutorials, and in our packaging and
peer review guidebooks. Many long-standing issues and bugs were fixed thanks to
this wonderful Python community.

We had so much activity that I'm still working on closing up issues and pull
requests now—weeks after the sprint ended!

After such a tremendous experience this year, I wanted to share with you the
things that we've learned at pyOpenSci about running beginner-friendly sprints.


## What is a sprint like?

If you haven’t been to a sprint before, it’s an experience every open source
enthusiast should have. Sprints are where people come together to work on a
project. The word sprint can also be used in a professional development setting. This might describe a team of developers working
together to release a new feature. For the volunteer open source community, sprints often mean volunteers
helping maintainers work on various parts of a project. And it's important to keep in mind that often the maintainers are
also volunteers themselves.

### What do people sprint on for pyOpenSci?

pyOpenSci is a nonprofit organization that is devoted to building diverse and
inclusive community that supports making science more open and collaborative.
Among other things that we do, we run [open peer review of scientific Python software](/about-peer-review/index.html).

Running an volunteer-lead open peer review process for software is a challenge. As we grow,
it requires infrastructure to support tracking the process. We also create
community driven beginner-friendly
 [Python packaging resources](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/) and
 [tutorials](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/intro.html).
High quality learning resources also require maintenance and review.
As such, we always need a mixture of packaging experts and those newer to packaging
to help catch errors and identify points of confusion.

As the Executive Director and Founder of pyOpenSci, I created most of our
pyOpenSci GitHub infrastructure to support our mission. While I cherish times
when I can work on technical things, it’s hard to keep up.
Mission, vision and community work will always come first.

I really appreciate when community members help us tick off open issues,
big and small. These contributions propel the pyOpenSci mission of making science
more open and collaborative forward.

### Contribution opportunities

While barriers to contribution are abundant and hard, there are also many opportunities,
including:

* Learning and growing skills that may not be accessible in your day job.
* Connecting with other developers, data scientists, and scientists in the community.
* Engaging and being part of an online community or maintainer team.
* Growing your professional network.
* Learning about a new project.

Or, maybe you're like me —- an Executive Director of a community organization.
Coding and development aren't in my job description, but to teach these topics,
I need to keep my skills fresh. And, I love to code. That's where open source
comes into my life!

  <figcaption> People have many different motivations for attending sprints. Understanding those motivations can go a long way in the sprinter and the sprint leader(s) having a collectively
  successful experience. </figcaption>
</figure>

## Barriers in contributing to open source

While sprints are a great way to engage the community in supporting an
organization's (or a project's) mission, there are many contributor barriers
that sprint organizers need to consider.

These barriers include:

* Time to contribute.
* Skills to contribute.
* Confidence in skills / fear of contributing the wrong thing.
* Privilege: This is a loaded one. Open source can't be diverse if it requires privilege.
  to participate.

And last but not least:

* GitHub: Using Git and GitHub is always one of the biggest technical barriers
that contributors encounter in their open source and data science journeys.


### Challenges vs opportunities

So how do we align the challenges that contributors face with the potential opportunities?

While new contributor sprints are not for everyone, and assume some level of privilege
in having the time and bandwidth to participate, they can be great for many.

But a sprint will only be a good experience if the contributor's needs and goals are also considered. Contributors need to gain something
from contributing, and this requires:

* time and care in designing the sprint, and
* time spent with newcomers during the sprint.

It's also important to note that the time required to participate is also a privilege for
many, if not most, maintainers who are already volunteering their time to maintain
a project! As such we can't expect all open source packages to be able to
support beginner contributions in a comprehensive way.

However, if you do have the bandwidth to hold a sprint that embraces, empowers and uplifts those who are newer to open source, there
is a lot to be learned from understanding learner motivations and types. And a few good experiences might mean that a beginner decides to stick around.

## Contributing vs learning

The educator inside of me can't help but align my experience in open source with
learner motivations. For me personally, contributing to open source met two of my goals
and interests:

* **Applied (project-based) learning:** I love to learn. Coding and data science are my
  happy places. But the learning needs to be directly applicable. If it isn't, I get bored. Moreover, if I can't see the application of the skill, I have little motivation to learn that skill!
* **Student-directed learning:** I love to learn on my own time, following my own
  processes that work for me. Open source allows me to do just that (and without the
  pressures of a specific deadline in most cases).

If you read the education literature, you will find both project-based learning and student-directed learning to be
a commonly discussed topic—especially as it relates to empowering people who are underrepresented in a space.

More on that next...

### The power of project-based learning

[Project-based learning](https://www.wpi.edu/project-based-learning/why-pbl) is
founded on the idea that meaningful, applied projects are the best way to teach
a topic. This works especially well in the data science space and has been found
to be particularly effective with underrepresented groups. In fact, I implemented
and collected data on this in a [previous project](https://www.leahwasser.com/training-diverse-communities-earth-data-science-corps)
that I designed and ran when I was in academia.

The idea behind project-based learning is that students select a topic they are
personally interested in. If they are learning data science, they can find data
to analyze and support their project. For underrepresented groups in STEM (and
most learners), applied learning resonates because it involves a topic they care
about and are motivated to pursue. Skills are learned in the process of achieving
a meaningful outcome.

It's similar to how you can immediately engage a diverse audience in GIS
(spatial data) with Google Earth by asking them to zoom into the area where they
live (place-based learning).

As a volunteer maintainer of [Stravalib](https://github.com/stravalib/stravalib),
I am motivated to work on Stravalib because I learn in a very applied way.

Sure, a sprint does not have the powerful outcome of a student understanding the
impacts of climate change on their local tribal lands. But the concept is the same:

> The learning motivation comes from a meaningful outcome that a student wants or
> cares about.

In leading a sprint, asking the question of "what are your goals for today?" will
help you as a sprint leader to direct sprinter efforts down a successful path.


### The power of student-directed learning

Every person has different learning preferences. For many years, educators
taught people the same way: in a classroom, using the same books and approaches.
However, alternatives to this model allow learners to adapt their environment to
their personal and learning goal needs.
[Student-directed learning](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=student-directed+learning&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart)
is based on the idea that people learn differently and have different needs. By
creating a hybrid learning environment where students are allowed to pick their
learning path and approach, you empower them to own their experience.

Some learners benefit from hands-on demos, whether in a classroom or at the
sprint table. They may pick things up quickly or need to watch and digest the
demo. Others prefer reading quietly on their own, absorbing information, and
trying things out until they figure it out.

If a sprint is set up correctly, learners can parse through available issues.
Carefully tagged issues direct them to ones that are beginner-friendly. These
issues should not require extensive Git and GitHub expertise, ensuring a good
first experience and an early win to build confidence.

Contributors at the sprint can decide if they need direction, mentorship, or
just a short tutorial/guidebook for making their first contribution using the
GitHub interface.


### Collaborative Git and GitHub lessons

This past year, I was awarded the [Better Scientific Software (BSSw)
Fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program), in which I proposed
lessons on these lesser-known collaborative Git and GitHub skills—the same skills
that will support people attending sprints! I am looking forward to having these
lessons on hand for next year's sprints, in order to support those who are still
fighting to learn Git and GitHub (it can be an uphill process!).

## The anatomy of a pyOpenSci sprint

Based on my understanding of the learning motivations and challenges that new
contributors face, I've developed a pyOpenSci sprint approach that I've found to
be successful in empowering new contributors to make their first contributions.

### Create opportunities for first-time contributors

When someone joins your sprint, start by asking:

1. What are you looking to achieve today?
2. How comfortable are you with Git and GitHub?

If the contributor is new to Git and GitHub, it can be empowering to direct them
to review documentation with a fresh perspective. In our pyOpenSci sprints,
beginners often find bugs and issues in our online packaging tutorials. Fixing
these bugs is empowering for new contributors and helps pyOpenSci curate useful,
current, and beginner-friendly content.

If you have a package, let the user review your tutorials or docs. They can then
either open issues or pull requests to address the issues.

The beauty of documentation reviews is that any issues and PRs submitted can be
done entirely using the GitHub interface. This is a true win/win for both the
maintainer and the contributor.

### Write useful constructive issues

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/2024/june/pyopensci-issue-specific.png"
  alt="Image that says 'have you ever felt confused about python packaging.' Below
  is the pyopensci flower logo. And the graphic shows a bunch of different cartoon
  like hands being raised." style="width: 80%;" />
  <figcaption>This is an issue opened in our pyConUS 2024 sprint that could be
  addressed in a future sprint. Often before a sprint, our team will go into the
  existing issues and add more information related to next steps associated with the
  sprint. In this case - a beginner could take on testing out the Hatch installation
  instructions. They could also add a note that Hatch installs Python for a user if
  they don't already have it installed.</figcaption>
</figure>

A good sprint begins with useful, labeled issues. The information in the body of
an issue is critical. Be sure to include the specific details of the issue to be
addressed with the lens of someone who is new to your project. Give potential
contributors everything they need to start working, which helps reduce
administrative questions during the sprint. For a table of 10-20 people sprinting
for pyOpenSci, this means the sprint leader will have fewer questions to answer
during the sprint event.

### Label issues as help-wanted and/or sprintable

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/2024/june/pyopensci-sprint-label-issues.png" alt="Graphic says Label issues with help-wanted / sprintable. Below it is a list of issues from the GitHub interface. One of the issues in the list is well labeled. It has 3 labels that say beginner-friendly, help wanted and then sprintable. Each has a different color." style="width: 80%;" />
  <figcaption> We like to label issues as help-wanted and sprintable. A sprintable issue is a discrete issue that could be tackled (and ideally completed) during a sprint. A sprint's duration can span from  a half day to multiple full days depending on the event. What is most important is that the issue is confined in some way so a single person could tackle it in a reasonable amount of time.</figcaption>
</figure>

You never know when a contributor might be looking for a data science project to
work on. It's always helpful to tag issues that could be completed or started
during a sprint as `sprintable` and `help-wanted` if you think someone outside
of your team could tackle the issue. This tip came from
[Inessa Pawson](https://github.com/InessaPawson), who has extensive experience
with contributors through her work on the
[Contributor Experience Project](https://contributor-experience.org/).

### Collect issues in a single place—the help-wanted board

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/2024/june/pyopensci-sprint-project-board.png" alt="A graphic that shows the pyOpenSci GitHub project board. The graphic shows two columns of the project board. The first is Python Packaging and it has 7 issues in that column. The second column says Beginner-friendly / non technical. The point of this graphic is just to show a user that a project board is a nice way to organize issues that contributors might want to challenge during a sprint. At the bottom there is text that says includes a beginner-friendly column and should have easy-to-understand issue titles." style="width: 80%;" />
  <figcaption> Project boards help you organize your sprintable tasks into categories that might help a contributor find something that interests them. Here we have a beginner-friendly column for beginners, but we also include columns that are topical such as Python programming, CI / DevOps and Sphinx. Also notice that the issues are generally clearly titled.</figcaption>
</figure>

Curate a `help-wanted` board that contains all the issues that could be completed
by an outside community member in one place.

Our pyOpenSci `help-wanted` board is a
[GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/pyOpenSci/projects/3/views/2)
that allows us to organize issues that we think others could work on by type,
including:

* Beginner-friendly
* Python
* DevOps / CI

### Infrastructure and automation of issues

PyOpenSci has many GitHub repositories where people might label an issue as
`help-wanted` and forget to add it to our sprint help-wanted project board. To
address this, we set up
a [CI workflow](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyopensci.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/add-help-wanted.yml)
that can be added to any repository. This workflow moves any issue labeled
`sprintable` or `help-wanted` to our help-wanted GitHub project board.

**GitHub project boards support project workflows** that auto-add issues to a
project board with a specific label. However, our GitHub organization's open source
subscription only allows for one project workflow of this kind associated with one
repository, which is why we set up the GitHub action. We also have things setup so an issue is removed / archived from the GitHub project board once it is closed.

### Make it truly beginner-friendly

To support beginners contributing to open source, consider having one or two
helpers (depending on the size of your sprint) who can assist with:

1. Understanding the issues
2. Using Git/GitHub
3. Directing novice sprinters to beginner-friendly items

In all of our sprints to date, we have had a mixture of people who:

1. Know Git and GitHub but haven't contributed to open source before. Sometimes
   these people are developers and can tackle coding challenges!
2. Are seasoned and just need enough information in the issue to be successful
   (see above section on issue content).

Other times, you have people who really want to contribute but are uncomfortable
with Git and GitHub and have never contributed to open source. These people will
be incredibly empowered if you can create a smooth path to their first
contributions.

## Wrap up

Well-led sprints offer both new and seasoned contributors an opportunity to
contribute to a project, while also learning new skills, connecting with new
people, and learning about new projects. If you plan to support new
contributors in your sprint, then it's ideal to do some legwork before the
sprint begins to ensure sprint attendees feel supported and have the help that
they need when they get stuck.

pyOpenSci is looking forward to our next sprint—to be held at the [SciPy 2024
meeting](https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/) in Tacoma, Washington. Last year we
had three people make their first contributions to open source in our SciPy
2023 sprint. I'm hoping that this year is even better!

Come join us if you are there!
