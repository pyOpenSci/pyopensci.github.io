## Chicago, cats, and community

Iâ€™m thrilled to be joining pyOpenSci (pyOS) as the Community Manager, and bringing my experiences as a researcher, educator, and developer advocate to support the creation and maintenance of free and open Python tools for processing scientific data. Iâ€™ve spent most of my adult life building online communities, from video games to programming to data science, and itâ€™s exciting to see so many familiar faces in my first weeks at pyOS.

One of the things Iâ€™m most excited to bring to pyOS is the creation of engaging, approachable, and accessible technical content around some of the thornier Python issues, like [packaging](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html)! Whether itâ€™s blog posts, social media content, or videos, I want to ensure that our educational materials are available to everyone, regardless of geography.

Another area that Iâ€™ll be particularly focused on is the [pyOS Peer Review program](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html). The Peer Review program with pyOS supports scientists in getting credit for the efforts theyâ€™ve invested in open source Python tools, while also supporting the standardization of packaging and improved package visibility. And as the pyOS Community Manager, I want to help celebrate all of the hard work that authors, maintainers, and editors put into package development by sharing behind-the-scenes stories, package announcements, and the contributions of every individual with the broader community.

When Iâ€™m not helping build equitable, diverse, and accessible technical communities, Iâ€™m chilling with my two cats, Jinx and Luna, or riding my bike on the incredible gravel trails in the Chicago area.

## Why pyOpenSci

I first got started in scientific programming during my time as a graduate student in Immunology and Infectious Diseases. Learning R opened up a world of possibility for me, and I eventually used that early experience to build a career in data science. And out of all the learning materials available, I found the community to be the most critical in my success. While Iâ€™m no longer spending my days coding, I wanted to continue working with supportive, welcoming, and educational online communities that were focused on helping its members solve technical challenges.

pyOpenSci meets all of those criteria, and the more I learned about its philosophy around community building, as well as all of the ways for people of all levels of technical knowledge to get involved, the more I knew I wanted to be a part of things. Iâ€™m still within my first month at the organization, but I can already tell that itâ€™s a special place to be. Keep an eye out, because Iâ€™ve already started planning content and activities to help grow our community!

## Let's connect!

Iâ€™ll also be managing the social media accounts for pyOpenSci, and there are so many fantastic places for us to connect and have a conversation. pyOpenSci is currently active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pyopensci), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/pyopensci.bsky.social), and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@pyopensci), where weâ€™ll be sharing all kinds of news, updates, and community spotlights. Be sure to follow us so you donâ€™t miss out on anything! And join our growing [Discourse community](https://pyopensci.discourse.group/), which is a great place to connect with other pyOpenSci community members, learn more about pyOpenSci, and get answers to all of your burning Python packaging and code questions.

I canâ€™t wait to connect and help build the pyOpenSci community with you!
