## <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> To 200 and beyond!

This past month, pyOpenSci reached a major milestone: [200 contributors](https://www.pyopensci.org/our-community/index.html)! We have a diverse and vibrant community of Pythonistas, and are thrilled that 200 (and counting) wonderful people have contributed to pyOpenSci. Will you be next? [Learn more about getting involved](https://www.pyopensci.org/volunteer.html).


## <i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i> Launched: editor spotlight

pyOpenSci editors are volunteers who fulfill a critical role within pyOpenSci. Editors lead the open peer review process for three to four Python packages a year, and also weigh in on group editorial decisions. With everything they do for pyOpenSci, we wanted to celebrate them! In March we kicked off our pyOpenSci editor spotlight, where every Wednesday we share a short interview with one of our editors. You can catch up with previous spotlights, and stay tuned for more, on both our [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@pyOpenSci) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pyopensci) pages.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i> PyCon US 2024 Maintainers Summit

We’ve been talking (a lot) about the [PyCon Maintainers Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/maintainers-summit/) (which is now full, but [you can sign up for the waitlist](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/maintainers-summit/)), happening this May in Pittsburgh. The Maintainers Summit, included in your [PyCon registration](https://us.pycon.org/2024/accounts/login/?next=/2024/registration/register), is where we come together to discuss and foster best practices on how to develop sustainable projects and nurture thriving communities. And thanks to [Mariatta Wijaya](https://mariatta.ca/), we’ve got an inside look into everything you can expect in [this incredible video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Ok_89QJOM) featuring Kara Sowles, Inessa Pawson, and our Executive Director, Leah Wasser!

[EOmaps](https://eomaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has joined the pyOpenSci ecosystem! Developed by [Raphael Quast](https://github.com/raphaelquast), EOmaps is built on top of matplotlib and cartopy and integrates well with the scientific python infrastructure (e.g., numpy, pandas, geopandas, xarray etc.), allowing you to visualize point-, raster- or vector-datasets provided in almost any format you can imagine, no matter if you're dealing with just a few unsorted data points or multi-dimensional stacks of global high-resolution datasets.

Learn more about pyOpenSci’s open peer review process by reading through the [EOmaps submission](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/138) or checking out our [peer review page](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> Launched: pyOpenSci package showcase

pyOpenSci currently has [28 packages](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html) that have been accepted through our open peer review process, and we want you to get to know them better! This is why we’ve launched our pyOpenSci package showcase, which highlights an accepted package and its author(s) every Tuesday and Thursday on our [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@pyOpenSci) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pyopensci) pages.

Have a package you’ve developed, but aren’t sure it’s in scope for pyOpenSci? Complete a [pre-submission inquiry](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/new?assignees=&labels=presubmission&projects=&template=presubmission-inquiry.md&title=) and one of our editors will be in touch!
