## Image alignment

Position images with the following classes.


### Figure -- align center

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024." style="width: 50%;">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024. Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024. Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024. Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024. </figcaption>
</figure>

The image above happens to be **centered**.

```html
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024.">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>
```


### Figure -- align left

<figure class="align-left">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024." style="width: 50%;">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>


The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**. There should be plenty of room above, below, and to the right of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that left side. I don't care what the right aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

```html
<figure class="align-left">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024.">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>
```

You can also adjust the width inline:

```html
<figure class="align-left">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024." style="width: 50%;">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Figure -- align right

Below is a right aligned image

<figure class="align-right">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024." style="width: 50%;">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>


And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

The html looks like this:


```html
<figure class="align-right">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024.">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Figure -- full extending outside of the current area

The image below should extend outside of the parent container on right.


<figure class="full">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024.">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>




```html
<figure class="full">
  <img src="/images/pyopensci-general/pyopensci-timeline2019-2024.png" alt="A timeline showing the growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024.">
  <figcaption>Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024 Growth of pyOpenSci from 2019 to 2024</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Blockquote styles

### Regular blockquote

```markdown
> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote }
```

> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.


### Fancy blockquote

```markdown
> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote }
```

> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote }


### Fancy blockquote magenta & purple variants

```markdown
> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote .magenta }
```

> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote .magenta }


```markdown
> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote .purple }
```

> This entire effort underscores the power of community when guided in
> the right direction, showcasing how collective effort can drive
> meaningful progress.
{: .highlight-quote .purple }


### Quotes using include files

You can also create blockquotes using include files.
Below is a green and magenta version of the same quote

````html
{% raw %}
{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight magenta" %}
{% endraw %}
````

{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight magenta" %}

```markdown
{% raw %}
{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight purple" %}
{% endraw %}
```

{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight purple" %}

The default color for the quotes is the pyos teal green.

```
{% raw %}
{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight" %}
{% endraw %}
```

{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight" %}

### Quotes in notice blocks

```
<div class="notice">
{% raw %}
{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight" %}
{% endraw %}
</div>
```

<div class="notice">
{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="[*I want to... *] Streamline the development of good quality, socially responsible, and easily shareable software." author="Anonymous" event="AGU 2019 Townhall" class="highlight" %}

</div>

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn .btn--primary` classes.

```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn--primary">Link Text</a>
```

## Notices

Call attention to a block of text.

| Notice Type | Class              |
| ----------- | -----              |
| Default     | `.notice`          |
| Primary     | `.notice--primary` |
| Info        | `.notice--info`    |
| Warning     | `.notice--warning` |
| Success     | `.notice--success` |
| Danger      | `.notice--danger`  |

**Watch out!** This paragraph of text has been [emphasized](#) with the `{: .notice}` class. The purpose of this test paragraph is to check how different styles are applied across various sections of text. You can [highlight](#) certain words or phrases, adjust the [font size](#), or change the [text color](#) to see how the styling adapts. Additionally, experimenting with [different classes](#) and observing the effects on alignment, spacing, and other typographic elements will help ensure that your CSS is applied consistently and effectively across your site.
{: .notice}

**Watch out!** This paragraph of text has been [emphasized](#) with the `{: .notice--primary}` class.
{: .notice--primary}

**Watch out!** This paragraph of text has been [emphasized](#) with the `{: .notice--info}` class.
{: .notice--info}

**Watch out!** This paragraph of text has been [emphasized](#) with the `{: .notice--warning}` class.
{: .notice--warning}

**Watch out!** This paragraph of text has been [emphasized](#) with the `{: .notice--success}` class.
{: .notice--success}

**Watch out!** This paragraph of text has been [emphasized](#) with the `{: .notice--danger}` class.
{: .notice--danger}

<div class="notice" markdown="1">
You can also add the `.notice` class to a `<div>` element like this:

```html
<div class="notice">
You can also add the .notice class to a <div> element.

* Bullet point 1
* Bullet point 2
</div>
```

</div>

To add a heading element to a notice  block but ignore in the TOC, use `no_toc` as a class like this:

```html
<div class="notice--info">
  <h4 class="no_toc">Notice Headline:</h4>
   here is some html text.
</div>
```

Which will render like this

<div class="notice--info">
  <h4 class="no_toc">Notice Headline that won't appear in toc</h4>
  {{ notice-text | markdownify }}.
  You can add more text here too
</div>




Using the Kramdown Markdown renderer with Jekyll allows you to add [block](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#block-attributes) and [inline attributes](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#inline-attributes). This is nice if you want to add custom styling to text and image, and still write in Markdown.

**Jekyll 3:** Kramdown is the default for `jekyll new` sites and those hosted on GitHub Pages. Not using Kramdown? That's OK. The following classes are still available when used with standard HTML.
{: .notice--warning}
