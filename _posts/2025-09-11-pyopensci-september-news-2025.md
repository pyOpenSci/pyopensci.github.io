The summer was full of connection, collaboration, and momentum in the pyOpenSci community. Whether you joined us at [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), submitted a package for review, or just lurked in Slack, we‚Äôre so grateful you‚Äôre here!

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening üëá

## **üí¨ Community Shoutouts**

**Welcome, Philip Narteh!**

We‚Äôre thrilled to welcome [**Philip Narteh**](https://github.com/Phinart98) as pyOpenSci‚Äôs very first **Open Source Infrastructure Intern**, supported by [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/), [Melissa Mendon√ßa](https://github.com/melissawm), and [Tania Allard](https://github.com/trallard). Philip will be helping us migrate our website to [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), bringing valuable experience in accessibility within the Django ecosystem. We‚Äôre so excited to have you here, Philip!

**Contributor milestones**

We‚Äôve also had some meaningful leadership transitions happen.

* [**Tracy Teal**](https://github.com/tracykteal) completed her term as our founding Executive Council Chair after three transformative years. The Executive Council is the leadership body that guides pyOpenSci‚Äôs strategy, governance, and long-term sustainability. You can think of it as the group that helps us make big-picture decisions and ensures our work stays aligned with our mission. [Learn more about the Executive Council.](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/governance/executive-council.html)
* [**Karen Cranston**](https://github.com/kcranston) has stepped in as our new Executive Council Chair, and **April Johnson** has joined as a new Council member.

These transitions highlight pyOpenSci‚Äôs growing maturity and sustainability as an organization.

We also want to celebrate our editorial team:

* [**Eliot Robson**](https://github.com/eliotwrobson) transitioned into the Editor-in-Chief role for our peer review process.
* [**Chiara Marmo**](https://github.com/cmarmo) and [**Isabel Zimmerman**](https://github.com/isabelizimm) wrapped up their terms as Editors after years of thoughtful reviews and community care. Thank you both!

## **üé§ SciPy 2025 Highlights**

Over 60 people joined our Birds of a Feather (BoF) session to discuss challenges in research software and what community-driven peer review can do to help. It was one of our most energizing community sessions yet!

We also:

* Kicked off the conference with our packaging workshop, introducing folks to our user-friendly template and modern tools like Hatch and UV.
* Welcomed many first-time contributors at our community sprint, with **over 30 PRs opened in one day**!
* Shared lightning talks, saw Pixi in action, and even got a **SciPy Song shoutout**.

Big thanks to everyone who contributed to our SciPy presence‚Äîespecially Jonny Saunders, Avik Basu, Jeremiah Paige, Inessa Pawson, Carol Willing, Tetsuo Koyama, and many others who made our workshop and sprints welcoming and impactful.

## **üîç Peer Review Updates**

We‚Äôre excited to see continued momentum in our software review process! Right now, **13 packages are actively under review,** and another **10 are in prereview** (the early stage before formal review begins). You can explore the [live review status board](https://www.pyopensci.org/metrics/peer-review/current-review-status.html) anytime to follow along.

üéâ Recently accepted packages include:

* [**PIVA**](https://github.com/pudeIko/piva) (August 4, 2025) ‚Äî A visualization and analysis toolkit for experimental data from [Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES)](https://arpes.stanford.edu/research/tool-development/angle-resolved-photoemission-spectroscopy).
* [**CyNetDiff**](https://github.com/eliotwrobson/CyNetDiff) (August 22, 2025) ‚Äî A performance-focused library for simulating network diffusion processes using [Cython](https://cython.org/).

A big congratulations to the maintainers of these projects, and a thank you to the reviewers and editors who supported them through the process.

## **üß† Community Learning + Behind-the-Scenes**

**Event Recap: [Improving Research Software through Peer Review](https://www.pyopensci.org/events/pyopensci-stanford-ospo-peer-review.html)**

On August 7, we partnered with Stanford‚Äôs OSPO for a virtual session exploring how pyOpenSci‚Äôs peer review model strengthens research software and supports contributor recognition.

**New blog updates**

If our blog posts feel a little more structured, community-centered, and friendly lately‚Äîsay hi to our new **Communications and Community Lead, Mandy Moore!** She‚Äôs been working behind the scenes on everything from SEO-friendly image tags to blog polish to social media storytelling.

Bonus: She even learned a little HTML for it. üòâ
