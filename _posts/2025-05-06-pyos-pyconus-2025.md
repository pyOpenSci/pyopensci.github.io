## PyCon US Maintainers Summit: Co-hosted by pyOpenSci

I'm thrilled to be a second-time organizer of the PyCon US [Maintainers Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/maintainers-summit/) alongside long-time organizer [Inessa Pawson](https://github.com/InessaPawson) and Python Steering Council alum and past PyCon chair [Mariatta Wijaya](https://github.com/mariatta). This annual event brings maintainers, contributors, and community leaders together to share challenges and strategies in maintaining and sustaining open source software.

All are welcome to attend, listen to talks, and connect with fellow Pythonistas who care about maintaining open source software!

## Python packaging summit

We’re also excited to attend the **Packaging Summit** this year. There's been a lot of work to improve the Python packaging ecosystem in the past year. This event is an excellent opportunity to learn more about current efforts.

## Community lead activities

Our advisory council member Chase Million will be hosting a space-focused open space (that's a mouthful!!), so if you are in the space science arena, keep an eye out on the Open Space board in the Hallway track at PyCon US for that!

Also, check out [Zack Weinberg's talk on writing Extensions in Python that can be interrupted if you need to pause the task](https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/39/).
