## Meet Mandy Moore, pyOpenSci’s new Communications and Community Lead!

We’re thrilled to introduce **Mandy Moore** as our new **Communications and Community Lead** at [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/)\!

Mandy joins us in a part-time role focused on growing and supporting our community through clear, engaging, and inclusive communication. She’s already helping us shape how we show up across platforms, whether that’s through newsletters, social posts, blogs, or behind-the-scenes strategy. Her work is helping us highlight not just what we do at pyOpenSci, but who we’re doing it for.

Mandy brings more than 15 years of experience in marketing, content strategy, podcast production, and community engagement—primarily in the broader tech world. While she’s newer to both Python and open science, she’s no stranger to translating technical work into accessible, human-centered content. Over the years, she’s worked behind the scenes on developer-focused podcasts, led marketing for startups, and helped open source projects share their impact and grow inclusive, welcoming communities.

At pyOpenSci, Mandy is leading our blog, social media, newsletter, and contributor communications. If you’ve noticed a friendlier voice on LinkedIn or seen our blog posts getting more structured and community-centered, that’s Mandy at work.

In addition to her work with pyOpenSci, Mandy runs a freelance business supporting mission-driven startups, open source projects, and solo founders. Her services span everything from content strategy and social media to podcast production and branding. She’s worked with projects like [Leapter](https://www.leapter.com/), [WPConcierge](https://wpconcierge.com/), and the [Dead Code Podcast](https://deadcode.website), and she’s always up for a good brainstorm about making tech more human and accessible.

Her role supports one of the most essential parts of pyOpenSci’s mission: **making scientific open source more accessible, more visible, and more sustainable**. Through thoughtful content and community engagement, Mandy is helping us break down both technical and social pain points, one story, post, or conversation at a time.

> “I’m not a scientist or a developer,” Mandy says. “But I *am* someone who believes deeply in open science, shared knowledge, and the power of good communication to bring people together. I’m honored to support this community and can’t wait to learn from all of you.”

Mandy lives in **York, Pennsylvania,** with her partner **Keith**, their three kids, and two very good dogs: **Gallagher**, a gentle golden retriever, and **Luna**, a tiny but mighty miniature Yorkshire Terrier. Outside of work, she’s a lifelong writer, recovering perfectionist, and astrology nerd who still gets excited about the magic of a well-written sentence. She’s currently in the middle of planning her November wedding, which means her calendar is full of both GitHub issues *and* flower mockups.

Please join us in giving Mandy a warm welcome\! You can find her in the [pyOpenSci Slack](https://www.pyopensci.org/slack), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/missmandymoore/) to say hi. You can also find her writing at <a href="https://www.exhotmess.net" target="_blank">exhotmess.net</a> and learn more about her tech work at [mandymoore.tech](https://www.mandymoore.tech).
