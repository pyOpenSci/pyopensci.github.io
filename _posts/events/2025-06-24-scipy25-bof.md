Collaborating on code and software is essential to open science—but it’s not always easy. Join this BoF for an interactive discussion on the real-world challenges of open source collaboration. We’ll explore common hurdles like Python packaging, contributing to existing codebases, and emerging issues around LLM-assisted development and AI-generated software contributions.

We’ll kick off with a brief overview of pyOpenSci—an inclusive community of Pythonistas, from novices to experts—working to make it easier to create, find, share, and contribute to reusable code. We’ll then facilitate small-group discussions and use an interactive Mentimeter survey to help you share your experiences and ideas.

Your feedback will directly shape pyOpenSci’s priorities for the coming year, as we build new programs and resources to support your work in the Python scientific ecosystem. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned developer, you’ll leave with clear ways to get involved and make an impact on the broader Python ecosystem in service of advancing scientific discovery.
