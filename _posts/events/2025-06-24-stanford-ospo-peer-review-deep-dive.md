## pyOpenSci: Improving research software and code through open and accessible peer review

* **When:** Thursday, 7 August @ 11:00 AM Mountain Time
* **Where:** Zoom: this event is for the Stanford Open Source Community

This event, hosted in partnership with [Stanford’s Open Source Program
Office](https://opensource.stanford.edu/), explores how [software peer review](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html) can help you build more reliable research tools, improve your coding and software development skills, and gain academic recognition while also connecting with a global community of practice that is dedicated to supporting the broader research and scientific Python community build better research software.

You’ll learn how pyOpenSci’s community-driven review
process supports open, sustainable Python software—and how to get
involved as a contributor or reviewer.

Peer review improves software quality, documentation, and long-term
sustainability—and gives contributors academic recognition through our
partnership with the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](
https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/joss.html).

The process is grounded in our [community-developed packaging
guidelines](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/index.html)
tailored to scientific software.

Whether you're building tools or reviewing them, you're helping shape a
more open, collaborative, and reproducible future for science. Join us
to improve research software—and get recognized for doing it.

### Why attend

- <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass-chart"></i> Learn what peer review
  looks like for research software
- <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Improve your own coding practices by reviewing
  real-world tools
- <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> See how others structure code, write
  tests, and document their work
- <i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> Gain visibility and academic credit for
  contributions
- <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i> Take a low-barrier first step into the
  open-source research ecosystem


### Building bridges: The power of our Stanford partnership

Through our partnership with Stanford, we're building a bridge between
the University Open Source Program Offices and the global open-source community that powers scientific
Python. Researchers and students gain access to high-quality, community-based
training in research software practices—without Stanford needing to create
that infrastructure from scratch.

This collaboration supports Stanford’s leadership in open, reproducible
science while giving its researchers meaningful opportunities to engage with
the pyOpenSci community and contribute to a broader, inclusive ecosystem of
scientific software development.
