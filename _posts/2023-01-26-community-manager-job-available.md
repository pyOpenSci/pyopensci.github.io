## FILLED: Job Posting: pyOpenSci Community Manager / Developer Advocate

IMPORTANT:
While we are keeping this post live, the job position is no closed as it has been filled. Thank you for your interest.

pyOpenSci is accepting applications for a Community Manager. The Community
Manager supports the creation of an inclusive pyOpenSci community that is
dedicated to high quality Python open source software.

## About pyOpenSci

pyOpenSci is a diverse scientific open source community that develops processes
and standards for creation and maintenance of scientific Python packages. We
also have a mission to increase participation of groups that have historically
underrepresented / excluded from the open source community
through both mentorship and strategic partnerships with existing organizations
such as [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/), [Open Science Labs](https://opensciencelabs.org/), [pyLadies](https://pyladies.com/), [geoLatinas](https://geolatinas.org/) and other
organizations.

pyOpenSci’s core program is open peer review of scientific Python software.
Through that program we enforce community-defined packaging standards while
improving usability, documentation and package quality. Further, our goal is to
curate a database of vetted scientific Python tools that have ongoing
maintenance.

pyOpenSci is a community owned organization, fiscally sponsored by Community Initiatives.

## What we are looking for

We are looking for someone with experience managing large, diverse online
communities. We hope that you are excited about facilitating outreach activities
and developing community partnerships. We also want you to be committed to
increasing diversity in the scientific open source software community. Ideally
you are also familiar with the Python programming language and goals of open
science.

This position provides the opportunity for someone to drive the pyOpenSci
mission of building a diverse and supportive community forward. This is a
part-time position (.75-.8 FTE) with full benefits. This position will report
to the pyOpenSci Executive Director.

Review of applications will begin on Feb 9, 2023 and will be ongoing until the
position is filled. This position, and all positions in our organization, is
grant funded. Current funds allocated through June 2024. Assuming project
success during the first two years, we will seek additional funding to extend
the work beyond June 2024. This position is fully remote. While our reach is
global, we prefer that you live in the United States.
