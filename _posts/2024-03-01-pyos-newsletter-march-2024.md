## <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> Welcome, AstroPy
pyOpenSci has officially partnered with the [AstroPy Project](https://www.astropy.org/) through our [Community Partnership program](https://www.pyopensci.org/partners.html). AstroPy is a Community Python Library for Astronomy, and the AstroPy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python, while also fostering interoperability between Python astronomy packages. We're thrilled to be partnering with the AstroPy project, and can't wait to share more!

    <figcaption> pyOpenSci adds an extra layer of community-specific review to our established open peer review process. This allows domain-specific scientific Python communities to vet affiliated tools through our robust peer review process. Communities then don’t have to develop and maintain their own review processes and software guidelines.

## <i class="fa-regular fa-sun"></i> Hello, sunPy

[sunPy](https://sunpy.org/), a Python package that provides fundamental tools for accessing, loading, and interacting with solar physics data in Python, has successfully gone through the pyOpenSci open peer review process, which is the first step in our budding partnership with the heliophysics community!

You can read more about sunPy and pyOpenSci in [this lovely blog post](https://sunpy.org/posts/2024/2024-01-24-pyopensci.html) from Nabil Friej.

## <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i> Say hi to sciform

[Justin Gerber](https://github.com/jagerber48) has developed the [sciform package](https://sciform.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is used to convert Python numbers into strings according to a variety of user-selected scientific formatting options, was accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem! sciform, like all of the pyOpenSci packages, completed the [pyOpenSci open peer review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html). And the community support around getting the sciform package review-ready was amazing to see!

Have a package you’ve developed, but aren’t sure it’s in scope for pyOpenSci? Complete a [pre-submission inquiry](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/new?assignees=&labels=presubmission&projects=&template=presubmission-inquiry.md&title=) and one of our editors will be in touch!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-plane-departure"></i> We're going to [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2024/)
Will we see you there? Our Executive Director and Founder, [Leah Wasser](https://github.com/lwasser), had her talk. [Friends don't let friends package alone](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/34/), all about Python packaging for scientists, accepted for this May's conference. We've seen a sneak peek of her talk, and guarantee that you won't want to miss it! Be sure to [register today](https://us.pycon.org/2024/accounts/login/?next=/2024/registration/register)!

## <i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> Congratulations, Leah!

Leah Wasser also received a [Better Scientific Software (BSSw) fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program) to create lessons around collaborative open science using GitHub. We plan to turn the lessons into online workshops. We'll be sure to let you know once they're ready for registration!

[BSSw](https://bssw.io/) provides a central hub for the community to address pressing challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i> New lessons are LIVE!
pyOpenSci released new and updated lessons in our [Python Packaging Guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/intro.html), designed to help scientists both make their Python code more shareable, as well as how to create a Python package. Be sure to check them out and let us know what you think!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-atom"></i> Upcoming Python Events for Scientists
### PyCon US 2024
The [PyCon US 2024 Maintainers Summit Call for Proposals](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/maintainers-summit/) is LIVE until March 25th! Share your insights and experiences on best practices, developing sustainable projects, and nurturing thriving communities in a 10--15 minute talk.

### PyConDE & PyData Berlin
Registration is still live for [PyConDE & PyData Berlin](https://2024.pycon.de/), so be sure to grab your tickets while they still last!

The event is scheduled for April 22nd--24th, _**with Inessa Pawson delivering the keynote address,**_ titled, "The Art and Science of Tending Open Source Orchards".
