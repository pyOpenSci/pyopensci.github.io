## Is your PyPI publication workflow secure?

We can learn a lot from the Python package breach [involving Ultralytics](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-12-11-ultralytics-attack-analysis/). This breach highlighted the importance of making our PyPI publishing workflows for Python packages more secure.

In this breach, hackers exploited a GitHub Actions workflow to inject malicious code into a Python package. This package was then published to PyPI. The outcome: users who downloaded the package unknowingly allowed their machines to be hijacked for Bitcoin mining.

While unsettling, there‚Äôs a silver lining: the PyPI security team had already addressed most of the issues that caused this breach.

This means that the important thing for us, as maintainers, is that we all should know how to lock down our publishing workflows.
Here, I'll cover the lessons learned that you can apply TODAY to your Python packaging workflows!

<div class="notice" markdown="1">
## TL;DR Takeaways

The fall 2024 Ultralytics breach was a wake-up call for all maintainers: secure your workflows to protect your users and the Python ecosystem. The most important steps that you can take are actually the simplest:

Below are **3 things that you can do right now** to secure your PyPI Python packaging workflow:

### Secure GitHub--Human and GitHub--PyPI connections

1. üîí If you have a GitHub Action that publishes to PyPI, make sure that the **publish section of your action uses a controlled GitHub environment**. Name that environment `pypi` and set environment permissions in GitHub that allow specific trusted maintainers to authorize the environment to run. I'll show you how to do this below.
1. ü§ù Create a **Trusted Publisher link between your package's (GitHub/GitLab) repository and PyPI**. You can call this trusted connection within the locked-down GitHub environment (named `pypi`) that you created above.
1. üçí Add [`zizmor`](https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/) to your build to check GitHub Actions for vulnerabilities. You can run zizmor on your workflow files locally, or you can set it up as a pre-commit hook which is probably a better bet.

Together, these three steps protect both sides of your PyPI publication process--the trigger on GitHub and the connection between GitHub and PyPI. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Don‚Äôt wait--start securing your Python publishing workflows today. üîí

## A call to (GitHub) actions ...

The Ultralytics breach highlights the need for us all to follow and understand secure PyPI publishing practices and carefully monitor workflows. Below are actionable steps you can take to enhance security when publishing Python packages to PyPI using GitHub Actions.

<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> [PyPA provides a great overview of using actions to publish your Python package.](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/)
{: .notice }

## <i class="fa-solid fa-box"></i> 1. Create a dedicated GitHub environment for publishing actions

First, make sure that your PyPI publish GitHub Action uses an isolated GitHub environment. Isolated environments ensure your publishing process remains secure even if other parts of your CI pipeline are compromised. This is because you can lock an environment down by ensuring that only specific users can authorize this environment to run.


A GitHub Action is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool that allows you to automate tests. [Click here to read more about what CI/CI is.](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/continuous-integration/ci.html)
{: .notice .notice--success }

If you look at the workflow example below, notice that we have an [environment called `pypi`](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyosMeta/blob/2a09fba/.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml#L57) that is used for trusted publishing. The `pypi` environment creates a direct link between this action and PyPI Trusted Published (discussed below).

```yaml
  publish:
    name: >-
      Publish Python üêç distribution üì¶ to PyPI
    if: github.repository_owner == 'pyopensci'
    needs:
      - build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: pypi
      url: https://pypi.org/p/pyosmeta
```
*****

To lock down a GitHub environment:

* First, go to the <kbd>Settings</kbd> in your repository where the workflow is run
* Within settings, select **environments** from the left-hand sidebar
* Add a new environment. Use <kbd>pypi</kbd> as your environment name; this is what PyPA (the Python Packaging Authority) recommends.
* Ensure <kbd>Required reviewers</kbd> is enabled. This setting allows you to designate specific individuals who can approve and manually run the workflow on GitHub. Any reviewers you add must have the appropriate permissions to authorize the workflow by clicking a button. This adds a human verification step to the process.
* Once the <kbd>Required reviewers</kbd> button is checked, add maintainers who you want to be able to enable the action to run.

*Optionally, you can click <kbd>prevent self-review</kbd>, preventing someone from triggering a release or a build and then running it!*

  <figcaption>
    To create a new environment to use in a GitHub Action, 1) go to your repo's settings; 2) click <kbd>environment</kbd>; 3) add a new environment. In this screenshot, we already have a <kbd>pypi</kbd> environment created. Note that you can name your environment whatever you want, however, PyPI suggests that you use the name <kbd>pypi</kbd> for a Trusted Publisher workflow.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i> 2. Use Trusted Publisher for PyPI

Now that you have a GitHub environment setup, you can set up Trusted Publisher in your PyPI account.

A Trusted Publisher setup creates a secure link between PyPI and your repository.
- PyPI is allowed to authenticate your [package distribution files (sdist and wheel archives)](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/python-package-distribution-files-sdist-wheel.html#how-to-create-the-distribution-format-that-pypi-and-pip-expects) uploads directly, so no additional configuration is required.
- Trusted Publisher restricts publishing to a specific GitHub Actions workflows and environments defined in your repository.

Using a Trusted Publisher combined with a locked-down environment eliminates the need to store sensitive tokens as GitHub secrets. It also removes the need to refresh and update tokens periodically to avoid token leaks or theft issues.

</figure>

If you only [publish locally to PyPI using the command line](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/publish-pypi.html), you must use a PyPI token. However, if you‚Äôre using GitHub Actions to automate your publishing process, setting up **Trusted Publisher** is a secure and easier-to-manage option.
{: .notice }

### How to get started

[PyPI provides a great guide to getting started with Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/).


The steps for setting up Trusted Publisher are:
1. Login to your PyPI account
2. Click on your profile to take you to **Your projects**.
3. Click on **publishing** on the left-hand side of the site. (it's below account settings).
4. At the top of the page is a Manage Publishers section. At the bottom, you will see **Add a new pending publisher**
5. Fill out a form that looks like the one below in the add a new pending publisher section. Notice that you can select GitHub, GitLab, Google and ActiveState as platforms.
6. Notice that the form asks for your project name, owner, repo name, workflow's file name, and environment (**STRONGLY recommended**).

{: .notice }

## <i class="fa-solid fa-check-double"></i> 3. Add `zizmor` to your CI workflows

Finally, consider adding [Zizmor](https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/) to your [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/continuous-integration/ci.html#what-is-continuous-integration) and [pre-commit checks](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/code-style-linting-format.html#use-pre-commit-hooks-to-run-code-formatters-and-linters-on-commits).

Zizmor is a static analysis tool designed to help identify GitHub Action security issues. Zizmor scans your workflows and highlights common vulnerabilities, ensuring your continuous integration / continuous deployment pipelines remain secure and efficient.

Named as a playful nod to Dr. Zizmor‚Äôs famous ‚Äúclear skin‚Äù ads, zizmor aims to give you ‚Äúbeautiful clean workflows.‚Äù

Learn more about zizmor on the [official blog post by William Woodruff](https://blog.yossarian.net/2024/10/27/Now-you-can-have-beautiful-clean-workflows).
{: .notice .notice--success }

### How it works

To use zizmor locally to check your workflows, first install it using `pip` or `pipx`:

`pip install zizmor`

Then, ask it to check a specific workflow file (or set of files).

Below, I ran it on our pyosMeta PyPI build. Among other things, it found a template injection risk in our build that we can easily fix by adding a sanitization step discussed below!

PyPI really is on top of things!

```console
$ zizmor .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml

error[template-injection]: code injection via template expansion
   --> path/here/pyosMeta/.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml:97:7
github.ref_name may expand into attacker-controllable code
```

You can also set up `zizmor` as a pre-commit hook. pyOpenSci plans to do this in the  future, but here is an example of it [set up for core Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/127749/files#diff-63a9c44a44acf85fea213a857769990937107cf072831e1a26808cfde9d096b9R64).

Pre-commit hooks run checks every time you commit a file to Git history. [Learn more about using them here.](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/code-style-linting-format.html#use-pre-commit-hooks-to-run-code-formatters-and-linters-on-commits)

## Other security measures you can consider

There are other things that we can learn too from the recent breach. Many of these will be identified if you set up zizmor. These are discussed below.


### Sanitize branch names in your workflow

One of the critical issues in the Ultralytics breach involved a
[**malicious branch name containing a shell script**](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/pull/18020)
that was executed because `github.ref` was used without sanitization. This type
of attack, known as **template injection**, allows malicious content in branch
names to be treated as shell commands.

{% include pyos-blockquote.html quote="...is a classic GitHub Actions template injection: the expansion of `github.head_ref || github.ref` is injected directly into the shell‚Äôs context, with no quoting or interpolation.." author="https://blog.yossarian.net/2024/12/06/zizmor-ultralytics-injection" class="highlight magenta" %}

Because the branch name wasn‚Äôt sanitized, it was treated as a shell command and executed with full permissions. Yikes!

In the example below, an unsanitized branch name could execute harmful commands:

```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run a script
        run: |
          echo "Running script for branch: $GITHUB_REF"
```

To prevent this, [sanitize or clean](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/dealing-with-special-characters-in-branch-and-tag-names) branch names before using them. A small Bash step can
remove unsafe characters:


```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Sanitize branch name
        run: |
          SAFE_BRANCH=$(echo $GITHUB_REF | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9_\-\/]//g')
          echo "Sanitized branch name: $SAFE_BRANCH"
          echo "Running script for branch: $SAFE_BRANCH"
```


## Lock down GitHub permissions & delete old PyPI tokens and GitHub secrets

In addition to securing your workflows, lock down your accounts and repositories. 2FA (2-factor authentication) is thankfully now required as a security measure for both GitHub and PyPI. However, be sure to store your recovery codes somewhere safe (like in a password manager!).

Also consider:

- **Revoking old tokens**: If you've previously created PyPI API tokens and/or associated GitHub secrets, delete any unused or outdated ones.
- **Restrict repository access**: Limit write GitHub repository access to a trusted subset of maintainers. Most contributors don‚Äôt need direct write access, which reduces security risks.


### üö´ Avoid `pull_request_target` and consider release-based workflows

A trigger event in a GitHub Action is an event that sets off an action to run. For instance, you might have a trigger that runs a linter like Black or Ruff when a new pull request is opened.

The [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) trigger event in GitHub Actions that Ultralytics used allows workflows to run with elevated permissions on the base branch, even when triggered by changes from a fork. Thus, your workflow becomes vulnerable when used as a trigger to push a release to PyPI.

Instead of a pull_request_target or a pull_request, consider adopting a **release-based publishing workflow**. This approach:

- Triggers publication workflows only on new versioned releases. You can lock down which maintainers are allowed to create releases using GitHub permissions
- Ensure workflows related to publishing are explicitly scoped to `release` events.

In the example GitHub Action `.yaml` file below, you see a `release` trigger defined. This tells the action to only trigger the workflow when you publish a release.


```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI
on:
  # By using release as a trigger, only GitHub users and actions with write access to make releases to our repo can trigger the push to PyPI
  release:
    types: [published]
```

Using a release-based workflow ensures that your publishing step is tightly controlled. A pull request will never accidentally trigger a publish build. This reduces your risk!



## Don‚Äôt cache package dependencies in your publish step

Caching dependencies involves storing dependencies to be reused in future workflow runs. This approach saves time, as GitHub doesn‚Äôt need to redownload all dependencies each time the workflow runs.

However, caching dependencies can allow attackers to manipulate cached artifacts. If this happens, the workflow may pull in compromised versions from the cache during the next run.
